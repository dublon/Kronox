# Kronox

This code is used to view Kronox data on a Full HD screen in portrait mode.
In my case it runs on a remotely controlled Raspberry Pi that downloads a jarfiles and runns them  or shows webpages(another story). 

Change in the file Constants.java and some of the images in the assets directory.

The jarfile should run direktly if you have java jre or jdk istalled on the computer.
