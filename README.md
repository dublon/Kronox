# Kronox

This code is used to view Kronox data on a Full HD screen in portrait mode.
In my case it runns on a remotely controlled Raspberry Pi that downloads a jarfiles or webpages(another story) 
This project shows this info like this:

Change in the file Constants.java and some of the images in the assets directory.

The jarfile should run direktly if you have java jre or jdk istalled on the computer.
